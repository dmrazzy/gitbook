# AA Community Hub - Devcon 7 SEA (2024)

## A dedicated event space for the Account Abstraction ecosystem, held at Devcon 7 in Southeast Asia.


The **Account Abstraction Community Hub** was a dedicated gathering space at **Devcon 7 (Thailand, 2024)**, designed to bring together the many sub-communities advancing Account Abstraction (AA). It served as a Schelling point for wallet developers, SDK maintainers, bundler and Paymaster teams, standards authors, and builders working to onboard the next billion users to Ethereum via AA.
