## Introduction and resources for the Account Abstraction community.

Account Abstraction is not just a technical upgrade — it's a **community movement**.

This space is evolving thanks to the collaborative work of protocol authors, wallet teams, infrastructure providers, developers, and curious users exploring new paradigms.

We believe:

- 🧠 Different approaches drive innovation and highlight trade-offs  
- 🛠 Multiple implementations make the ecosystem more secure and resilient  
- 🌍 A diverse community ensures better UX across use cases and users

## 👥 What You'll Find Here

This section highlights community initiatives we've launched or supported to grow the Account Abstraction ecosystem:

- **EF Grants**: Direct funding to teams building critical AA infrastructure and tools
- **HackenProof Bug Bounty**: A live program incentivizing security research of the ERC-4337 protocol  
- **Devcon 7 AA Community Hub**: A collaborative space we hosted in Devcon 7 Bangkok with demos, workshops, and meetups

We’re grateful to all the teams pushing this forward — from early adopters to skeptics. You’re helping shape a future where wallets are smarter, safer, and more inclusive.
