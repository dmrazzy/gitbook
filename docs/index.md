# ⭐️ Introduction

## What is ERC-4337?

ERC-4337 enables **Account Abstraction (AA)** on Ethereum without requiring any changes to the protocol. Instead of modifying Ethereum's base protocol, it introduces a new flow using `UserOperation` objects, a decentralized **alt-mempool**, and an on-chain **EntryPoint** contract.

This architecture unlocks powerful wallet features like:



- ✅ Custom signature schemes (e.g. passkeys, multisig)
- ✅ Gasless transactions via **Paymasters**
- ✅ One-click flows through batched calls
- ✅ Modular smart accounts with upgradability and recovery
- ✅ Wallet creation without EOAs or upfront ETH

Unlike centralized relayer-based solutions, ERC-4337 achieves these benefits while preserving decentralization through a **permissionless mempool** and **bundler** ecosystem.

## 🌐 Why This Documentation?

This documentation serves as your technical companion to everything ERC-4337 and beyond. It consolidates specs, summaries, and best practices to help you:



- Build or integrate **smart contract wallets**
- Understand the **UserOperation lifecycle**
- Leverage **Paymasters** for better onboarding
- Explore modularity and emerging standards
- Stay aligned with Ethereum's decentralization ethos

Let’s build the future of wallets — programmable, recoverable, and user-friendly — without compromising Ethereum's core values.
