# ERC-4337

## Overview and breakdown of the core Account Abstraction standard using the alt mempool approach.

ERC-4337 is the foundational standard for Account Abstraction (AA) on Ethereum. It enables programmable, secure, and flexible smart wallets—without requiring any changes to the Ethereum consensus layer.

---

## 🚀 What Does It Enable?

- **Programmable smart wallets** with custom auth (e.g., multisig, passkeys)
- **Gas abstraction** using ERC-20 tokens or Paymasters
- **Account deployment on first use** via `initCode`
- **Bundled operations** for better UX and gas efficiency
- **Signature flexibility**, enabling recovery, guardians, and more

## 🧱 Key Components

### 🧾 `UserOperation`

A new object type representing user intent. Think of it as a structured meta-transaction.

```ts
interface UserOperation {
  sender: address;
  nonce: uint256;
  initCode: bytes;
  callData: bytes;
  callGasLimit: uint256;
  verificationGasLimit: uint256;
  preVerificationGas: uint256;
  maxFeePerGas: uint256;
  maxPriorityFeePerGas: uint256;
  paymasterAndData: bytes;
  signature: bytes;
}
```

This structure is propagated through a separate **UserOp mempool**, not the legacy Ethereum transaction pool.

---

### 🚦 EntryPoint Contract

The singleton router that:

- Calls `validateUserOp()` on the sender account
- If present, calls `validatePaymasterUserOp()` on the Paymaster
- Executes the `callData` if validation succeeds
- Holds deposits for accounts, and deposits + stakes for paymasters

Smart accounts must explicitly **trust a specific EntryPoint contract**. During validation, wallets check `msg.sender == EntryPoint` to ensure the operation is invoked through the correct entrypoint.



---

### 📦 Bundlers

Nodes that:

- Monitor the UserOp mempool
- Select and simulate valid `UserOperation`s
- Submit bundles as part of blocks they build onchain

Bundlers assume the gas cost risk and are reimbursed by user accounts or Paymasters. They may apply local policies or reputation scoring (e.g., ERC-7562).

---

### 💰 Paymasters

Optional contracts that:

- Sponsor gas for accounts under programmable conditions
- Must stake and deposit ETH into the EntryPoint
- Can enforce rules off-chain or on-chain (e.g., API-based validation)

If `validatePaymasterUserOp()` succeeds, the Paymaster covers execution costs. If the operation fails, the Paymaster still pays the network fees.

---

## 🔎 Validation Flow

1. **User sends `UserOperation`** to a bundler
2. **Bundler simulates validation** using EntryPoint’s `simulateValidation()`
   - Checks signature, nonce, balance/stake, and paymaster logic
3. **If valid**, the bundler includes it in a bundle
4. **Bundle is sent** via `handleOps()`, and `UserOperation`s are executed atomically

---

## 🔐 Security & DoS Protections

- EntryPoint reverts with `FailedOp` if validation or execution fails
- Bundlers must pre-simulate using `debug_traceCall` to avoid gas loss
- ERC-7562 defines additional validation rules (e.g., no storage writes in `validateUserOp`)
- Only staked entities can access shared state during validation

## 🔄 Integration with Other Standards

- **EIP-7702** — Temporary delegation of EOAs to smart logic
- **ERC-6900 / 7579** — Modular account plugin standards
- **ERC-6492** — Signature validation for undeployed wallets
- **RIP-7560** — Native transaction type proposal for protocol-layer AA

## ✅ Summary

ERC-4337 is the backbone of smart wallet infrastructure on Ethereum. It introduces a new validation-execution flow via EntryPoint and enables bundlers, Paymasters, and flexible signatures—without requiring changes to Ethereum’s base protocol or compromising on decentralization or censorship resistance.
