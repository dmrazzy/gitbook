## Native Account Abstraction via a new transaction type in the Ethereum protocol.



RIP-7560 proposes a new **native transaction type** for Account Abstraction (AA), integrating smart contract account validation directly into the Ethereum protocol. Unlike ERC-4337, which operates entirely at the application layer, RIP-7560 modifies the Ethereum execution layer to enable **consensus-level AA**.

---

## ⭐️ Why Native AA?

While ERC-4337 avoids changes to Ethereum’s core protocol, it comes with certain tradeoffs:

- Relies on a **custom mempool** and infrastructure (EntryPoint, Bundlers)
- Adds ~42k gas overhead
- Harder to reason about censorship resistance and execution ordering

RIP-7560 eliminates those limitations by introducing an **official transaction type** that supports:

- Smart contract-based validation
- Direct inclusion in the canonical mempool
- Simplified gas accounting

---

## 🧑‍🏫 How It Works

RIP-7560 defines a new transaction format with two key changes:

- `tx.sender` **is a contract address**, not an EOA
- The contract must expose a `validateTransaction()` method

### Core Flow

1. Block proposer includes a native AA tx
2. Execution client calls `validateTransaction()` on the sender contract
3. If validation succeeds, proceeds to `tx.data` execution
4. Gas fees are deducted from the sender as normal

---

## 🎁 Benefits

- ✅ **Lower gas cost** (no meta-transaction wrapper)
- ✅ **Fully integrated into the canonical transaction pool**
- ✅ **Simpler UX and infra for L1 and L2 chains**

---

## 🔄 Compatibility

RIP-7560 is designed to complement (not replace) ERC-4337. Use cases:

- L2 chains may adopt RIP-7560 for native execution
- L1 may continue supporting ERC-4337 until protocol-level support is available
- Wallets and tooling may offer **dual support**

Tooling and RPC layers must be updated to handle the new transaction type.  
Clients must enforce validation during block inclusion, and wallets will need support for transaction encoding, nonce handling, and gas estimation.

## 🤝 Relationship to EIP-7701

EIP-7701 brings the same role-based Account Abstraction model to Ethereum **Layer 1**, while RIP-7560 is designed for **rollups**. Both introduce new EIP-2718-compatible transaction types and protocol-level validation.

RIP-7560 and EIP-7701 are not mutually exclusive — they represent the direction of native AA across Ethereum’s modular stack. Wallet and infra developers should consider support for both.

> RIP-7560 is primarily intended for rollups, whereas EIP-7701 targets Ethereum L1.

## 🤝 Relationship to ERC-4337

| Aspect | ERC-4337 | RIP-7560 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Mempool | Custom | Canonical |
| Deployment | On-chain infra | Consensus-layer update |
| Gas cost | Higher | Lower |
| Adoption path | Immediate | Requires fork |

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Validation logic must be gas-bounded and deterministic (same as 7562 rules)
- Misbehaving contracts can be slashed or rejected by block builders
- Client implementers must handle validation errors gracefully

---

## 💬 Status

RIP-7560 is not finalized or deployed yet. Discussions are ongoing within Ethereum and L2 core dev circles. 
It is tracked under the RIP (Rollup Improvement Proposal) process.

## ✅ Summary

RIP-7560 introduces a native AA transaction type, enabling smart contract wallet logic to be validated directly in the Ethereum protocol. It offers gas savings, simpler UX, and avoids reliance on custom infrastructure — but requires core protocol changes and is still under active discussion.
