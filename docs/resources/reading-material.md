## ðŸ¤¿ Deep Dives

- **[You Could Have Invented Account Abstraction - 4 part series](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/account-abstraction)**
  Reverse engineering AA capabilities while preseving strong censorship resistance and decentralization to better understand the reasoning behind ERC-4337's architecture.

- **[What are Paymasters?](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-paymaster)**  
  Technical overview of the different types of paymasters and how they work.

- **[What happens to a UserOp within a Bundler?](https://jiffylabs.hashnode.dev/what-happens-to-a-userop-within-a-bundler)**
  Why do we need a bundler when you can just relay the UserOp directly to the entrypoint from an EOA?

- **[Mempool Stages Framework](https://substack.com/home/post/p-163060056)**
The ERC-4337 Team introduced a framework which categorizes Bundler Mempool development into distinct stages. As the framework progresses, it enhances user benefits at every stage, such as censorship resistance, decentralization, and permissionless.
