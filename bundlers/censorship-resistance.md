# Censorship Resistance in ERC-4337

From the very beginning, ERC-4337 was designed to support a decentralized, censorship-resistant transaction flow for Account Abstraction. A key part of that vision was the creation of a **separate, peer-to-peer mempool for UserOperations**, distinct from Ethereum‚Äôs native transaction mempool. However, realizing this architecture took time ‚Äî and until late 2024, most bundlers relied on **private, isolated queues** that undermined the original goals.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Centralization Risk Without Global Propagation

In a fragmented ecosystem:
- Bundlers can selectively drop or ignore `UserOperation`s
- Users relying on a single RPC or bundler can be censored

Unlike Ethereum‚Äôs canonical mempool, inclusion guarantees are weaker unless the network shares UserOps widely.

---

## üåê Shared Mempool: Live and Decentralized

As of November 2024, the ERC-4337 Shared Mempool is live on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism. This milestone was achieved through a multi-team collaboration involving Etherspot, Candide, Alchemy, and others, marking a transition from private relays to a **decentralized propagation layer** for UserOps:

- Bundlers publish metadata to IPFS
- Peers use this metadata to discover compatible UserOps
- Valid operations propagate across nodes via gossip

Rather than requiring users to target a specific bundler, the shared mempool enables any participating bundler to see and process a submitted UserOperation ‚Äî mimicking the visibility guarantees of Ethereum‚Äôs base-layer mempool.

This makes censorship significantly harder. A malicious or non-cooperative bundler can no longer act as a gatekeeper: other bundlers will still see the UserOp and can include it in a valid bundle.

## üí° Design Implications for Developers

- Always integrate multiple bundler endpoints
- Prefer relayers that participate in the Shared Mempool
- Monitor submission status and resubmit if needed

---
## üåø From Training Wheels to Full Decentralization

The rollout of the shared mempool follows a **staged maturity framework**, inspired by Vitalik‚Äôs rollup decentralization stages:

- **Stage 0: Private Queues** ‚Äî No mempool, just per-bundler UserOp handling
- **Stage 1: Permissioned Sharing** ‚Äî Only whitelisted bundlers propagate UserOps
- **Stage 2: Controlled Decentralization** ‚Äî Shared but semi-restricted propagation
- **Stage 3: Fully Permissionless** ‚Äî Any compliant bundler can join and relay

The ecosystem is currently transitioning from Stage 1 to Stage 2, with growing adoption of peer-to-peer relays and emerging tooling to inspect and verify bundler behavior.

## ü§ù Relevance to EIP-7702

Even outside of ERC-4337, the Shared Mempool helps:
- EIP-7702 introduces temporarily smart-enabled EOAs
- These can be relayed via the UserOp mempool, not the canonical one
- This enhances censorship resistance for wallets adopting 7702 logic

Ethereum.org recommends using the UserOp mempool as a best practice for 7702 onboarding:
> *‚ÄúConsider using the UserOperation mempool for relaying smart EOA transactions to avoid base-layer censorship.‚Äù* [^1]

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Why This Matters

Without a shared propagation layer, censorship resistance is impossible. The ERC-4337 shared mempool finally delivers on the standard‚Äôs decentralization promise ‚Äî improving inclusion guarantees, reducing single bundler risk, and making it easier for wallets to route UserOps through resilient pathways.

Even with this infrastructure in place, users must still choose bundler-connected RPCs that support the mempool. Ecosystem adoption is growing fast, and continued tooling will make it easier to monitor bundler behavior and performance in this new permissionless layer.

## ‚úÖ Summary

Censorship resistance in Account Abstraction depends on open submission infrastructure. The live Shared Mempool, now standard in the ERC-4337 ecosystem, ensures that UserOperations can‚Äôt be easily suppressed or filtered, and even benefits 7702 workflows.
