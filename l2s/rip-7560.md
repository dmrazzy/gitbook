# RIP-7560: Native Account Abstraction Transaction Type

RIP-7560 proposes a new **native transaction type** for Account Abstraction (AA), integrating smart contract account validation directly into the Ethereum protocol. Unlike ERC-4337, which operates entirely at the application layer, RIP-7560 modifies the Ethereum execution layer to enable **consensus-level AA**.

---

## üîç Summary

RIP-7560 proposes a **new transaction type** in Ethereum where smart contract accounts can act as transaction senders at the protocol level.

This removes the need for the ERC-4337 infrastructure ‚Äî namely, the EntryPoint contract and off-chain bundlers. Instead, each account contract includes a `validateTransaction()` function that the execution layer directly invokes before transaction execution.

The goal is to:
- Simplify gas accounting and transaction flow
- Reduce gas overhead associated with ERC-4337‚Äôs indirection
- Improve inclusion guarantees by using the canonical mempool
- Make account abstraction native, not a workaround

RIP-7560 is part of the **RIP (Rollup Improvement Proposal)** track and is designed to be adopted by L2s first, where protocol upgrades are easier and faster to deploy. Eventually, this model could be considered for L1 Ethereum if successful on rollups.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Direct inclusion** by block proposers (no bundling)
- **Protocol-level validation** by account contracts
- **EIP-1559-compatible** gas pricing
- **Cleaner mempool integration** and reduced complexity

## ‚úÖ Summary

RIP-7560 represents a major evolution in how smart wallets might work at the protocol level. By removing the need for relayers and EntryPoint, and embedding AA directly into Ethereum‚Äôs core transaction model, it paves the way for more native, efficient, and censorship-resistant smart account execution.
