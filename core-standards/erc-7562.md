# ERC-7562: Validation Scope Rules for Account Abstraction

ERC-7562 sets the standard for how **UserOperations** must behave during the *validation phase* of execution. These rules are enforced **off-chain** by bundlers to protect the mempool and prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in systems using Account Abstraction (AA), such as ERC-4337, RIP-7560 and EIP-7701.

---

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Why This Matters

Unlike EOA transactions, AA introduces flexible logic during validation ‚Äî like custom signature schemes or Paymaster rules ‚Äî which are implemented in EVM code. Without restrictions, malicious users could submit computationally expensive or unstable `UserOperations`, wasting bundler resources and threatening network health.

ERC-7562 ensures that validation remains:
- **Deterministic**
- **Resource-bounded**
- **Isolated from shared mutable state**

---

## ü§î What Does It Apply To?

ERC-7562 governs the **validation phase** of:
- **ERC-4337 `UserOperations`**
- **RIP-7560 native AA tx types**
- Any protocol with smart contract-based validation

These restrictions **do not apply** to the *execution* phase.

---

## üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Categories of Validation Rules

### 1. Disallowed Opcodes

These opcodes are banned during validation for determinism and safety:

| Category | Examples                     | Reason              |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Non-deterministic | `BLOCKHASH`, `TIMESTAMP`, `NUMBER` | Can change between blocks |
| State-mutating | `SSTORE`, `SELFDESTRUCT` | May cause side effects |

---

### 2. Storage Access Restrictions

- Only **bounded and deterministic** reads are acceptable.  
- Unbounded iteration or state-dependent reads are allowed only if the contract is staked and reputation-tracked.


---

### 3. External Calls

- Validation should **not depend on arbitrary external contracts**.
- If external state is required (e.g., for a Paymaster or aggregator), that contract must be **staked and trusted**.

---

### 4. Gas and Stack Limits

- Bundlers must cap the gas allowed for validation.
- Deep call stacks or excessive memory usage will cause rejection.

---

### 5. Shared State Constraints

- Validation must not rely on shared mutable state **unless the contract is staked**.
- This prevents one `UserOperation` from invalidating thousands via state manipulation.

---

## ü§ù Staking for Exceptions

Smart contracts (e.g. Paymasters or Factories) that want to:
- Use external calls
- Access shared state
- Run more complex validation

...may do so **only if they are staked** and tracked in a local **reputation system** used by bundlers.

---

## üì¶ Bundler Enforcement

Bundlers are responsible for:
- **Simulating `UserOperations`** with `handleOps()` in view mode
- **Rejecting** any `UserOperation` that violates these rules
- Optionally maintaining a **reputation system** to throttle or ban abusive entities

These rules are enforced **off-chain by bundlers**. The EntryPoint enforces correctness on-chain, but not simulation rules like opcode bans or gas metering.

Bundlers may use tools like `debug_traceCall` to classify validation failures and protect themselves against gas griefing.


---

## üîÑ Compatibility

ERC-7562 is fully compatible with:
- ‚úÖ ERC-4337-based flows
- ‚úÖ RIP-7560 (L2 native AA)
- ‚úÖ EIP-7701 (L1 native AA)
- ‚úÖ Any custom AA mechanism that uses off-chain simulation

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

ERC-7562 provides the foundational guardrails for safe validation in Account Abstraction. It ensures that flexible wallet logic doesn‚Äôt lead to exploitable complexity, enabling scalable and censorship-resistant UX for smart accounts.

By defining strict off-chain validation constraints, ERC-7562 protects bundlers, preserves mempool health, and enables Account Abstraction to scale securely.
