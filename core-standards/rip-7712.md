# RIP-7712: Multi-dimensional Nonces for Native AA

RIP-7712 introduces a two-dimensional nonce mechanism for native Account Abstraction (RIP-7560) transactions. It enables Smart Contract Accounts to define their own transaction sequencing logic, making complex and parallelized workflows possible ‚Äî especially when multiple signers or execution threads are involved.

---

## üß± What It Adds

- **Two-dimensional nonces**: `(nonceKey, nonceSequence)` pairs replace the traditional sequential nonce
- **NonceManager contract**: Precompiled helper for validating and incrementing nonces
- **Enhanced parallelism**: Accounts can manage multiple nonce threads (e.g., for multisig vs routine ops)

---

## üîó Relation to Other Standards

| Spec         | Relation                                                  |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **RIP-7560** | RIP-7712 extends its native transaction type              |
| **ERC-4337** | Smart wallets already use custom nonces per validator     |
| **EIP-7702** | Revocation relies on legacy nonce; 7712 adds caveats      |
| **ERC-6900** / **7579** | Can map plugins to separate `nonceKey` lanes |

---

## ü§î Why It Matters

- Avoids **nonce collisions** across independent actions
- Enables **parallel UX flows** like multisig vs automation
- Powers **plugin-specific channels** for modular accounts

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

RIP-7712 introduces a `nonceKey` alongside the usual `nonceSequence`. Each `nonceKey` acts like an independent thread:

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) public nonce;
```

A `NonceManager` precompile handles validation and incrementing:

- `nonceKey = 0`: Uses legacy nonce (for EOAs and simple flows)
- `nonceKey > 0`: Uses the two-dimensional scheme
- Bundlers or builders must call the precompile to validate the pair

---

## ü§ñ Example Use Cases

- Threshold multisig vs user-level automation
- Plugin-specific nonces for fee payment, voting, recovery
- Delegated session key lanes (e.g. game moves, subscriptions)
- Atomic batch ops with concurrent replay protection

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats

- **EIP-7702** revocations use the legacy nonce ‚Äî applications must align `nonceKey = 0` for clean compatibility
- Some tooling (e.g. `eth_getTransactionCount`) may not support multi-key logic
- Wallets must expose nonce lanes clearly to avoid replay errors
