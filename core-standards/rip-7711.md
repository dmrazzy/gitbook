# RIP-7711: Native AA Mempool Protocol

RIP-7711 specifies how mempools should handle **native account abstraction transactions** introduced by RIP-7560. This ensures that L1 and L2 clients consistently propagate, validate, and prioritize native AA transactions.

---

## üß† Motivation

ERC-4337 transactions use a separate UserOp mempool, which limits compatibility with Ethereum‚Äôs native infrastructure. With RIP-7560 proposing native AA transaction types, RIP-7711 provides the **protocol rules** for:

- Propagation across peers
- Validation and simulation requirements
- Ordering and mempool eviction

---

## üß© Core Elements

### Transaction Type Support
Clients must support a dedicated transaction type for native AA. The payload structure is defined in RIP-7560.

### Validation Semantics
Clients must:
- Call `validateTransaction()` on the contract sender
- Simulate transactions prior to inclusion (clients may defer simulation until mempool admission)
- Ensure gas cost accounting and rejection rules are upheld

### Ordering Rules
- Native AA txs must be ordered based on fee priority, similar to regular txs
- Transactions from the same sender must respect nonce ordering (if applicable)

### P2P Protocol Handling
- Nodes must propagate native AA txs using devp2p, with support for typed transactions (EIP-2718)
- New tx type IDs or version tags may be used to distinguish native AA txs

---

## üîê Security & Anti-DoS

- Nodes must cap validation gas
- Misbehaving txs (e.g. failing validation) should be dropped early
- Clients may maintain local reputation scores to throttle spam
- Clients should apply gas caps to validation to prevent griefing
- Failed validations should return clear diagnostics (e.g., `FailedOp` analogs)

---

## üîÑ Compatibility

- Works with RIP-7560‚Äôs native tx type
- Can coexist with ERC-4337 infrastructure
- Encourages unification of tx handling across L1 and L2 networks

## ‚úÖ Summary

RIP-7711 provides the mempool-level coordination required to support native AA transactions introduced by RIP-7560. It standardizes propagation, simulation, and ordering rules to ensure a coherent experience across Ethereum clients and rollups.
